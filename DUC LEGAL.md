# i want to convert freecad to my own project and use some of its features for my application and commercialise it. am i legal ?

Based on the documentation files you provided and research about FreeCAD's licensing, here's the legal situation regarding commercial use of FreeCAD:

# FreeCAD Commercial Use: Legal Analysis

## **Yes, you can legally use FreeCAD for commercial purposes**

FreeCAD is licensed under the **LGPL 2+ (GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2 or later)**, which explicitly allows commercial use.[^1][^2][^3]

## What the LGPL License Allows

The LGPL license permits you to:[^4][^2][^1]

- **Use FreeCAD commercially** - free of charge for both commercial and non-commercial purposes
- **Redistribute** both source code and executable files
- **Modify** the FreeCAD source code for your needs
- **Create derivative works** for commercial applications
- **Link to FreeCAD libraries** in proprietary software (with conditions)


## Key Requirements and Limitations

### What you MUST do:

1. **Include license notice** - Retain the original LGPL license text and copyright notices[^4]
2. **Provide source access** - If you modify FreeCAD's core libraries and distribute them, you must make the modified source code available under LGPL[^4]
3. **Allow user modifications** - Users must be able to modify the LGPL components of your application[^4]

### What you CAN do:

- **Sell commercial applications** that use FreeCAD libraries
- **Keep your application code proprietary** (if properly separated from LGPL components)
- **Use FreeCAD as a foundation** for your commercial CAD software
- **Distribute modified versions** commercially


### What you CANNOT do:

- **Change the FreeCAD license** - Any modifications to FreeCAD core must remain LGPL[^4]
- **Use the "FreeCAD" trademark** commercially without permission (trademark owned by FPA)[^5]
- **Static link** LGPL code without providing rebuild information[^4]


## Best Practices for Commercial Use

### Dynamic Linking Approach

- **Recommended**: Use FreeCAD libraries as dynamically linked components[^4]
- Your proprietary code can remain closed-source
- Clearer separation between your code and LGPL components


### Creating Commercial CAD Software

You can legally:

- Fork FreeCAD and create a commercial version
- Add proprietary features on top of FreeCAD
- Charge for your enhanced version
- Keep your added features proprietary (if properly separated)


## Real-World Examples

The LGPL is specifically designed to encourage commercial use while protecting the open-source community. Many successful commercial applications use LGPL libraries.[^4]

## Summary

**You are legally permitted to commercialize FreeCAD-based applications**. The LGPL license was specifically created as a "bridge" between strict GPL requirements and permissive licenses to enable exactly this type of commercial use. Just ensure you comply with the license terms regarding source code availability for any FreeCAD modifications you distribute.[^4]

**Important**: While this analysis covers the general legal framework, consider consulting with a qualified intellectual property lawyer for your specific use case and jurisdiction.
